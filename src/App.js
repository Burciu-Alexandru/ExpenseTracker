// My first react app done during the first part of Max SchwarzmÃ¼ller
// An expense tracker app where you can your see expense filtered by year(until now)
// see a visual representation of how much you have speend by month and add new expenses

// One future improvement of the app could be that when you add a new expense it should be really 
// stored local:), until now it only store as long as you don't close the app :) 

// Really like how it look and learned a lot, one big thing I've learned while doing this app
// is that I should really be more focus on typos :)), that were my main stress on debugging
// what I mean by that is that verry often the source of my bug was not my logic but my typos :)
